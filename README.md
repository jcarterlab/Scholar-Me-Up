# Scholar-Me-Up

This notebook shows how you can you use large language models to learn about virtually any topic, including large language models. It uses Llama 2 7B-chat (accessed from Hugging Face) and Google Colab's free GPU access to retrieve a list of relevant academic papers on a given topic before summarizing them. 

You can choose the: 
- language style,
- paper type,
- number of papers,
- period and word count
